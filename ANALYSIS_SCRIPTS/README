#Instructions/LogBook of what has been done to analyze onepass data (ON THIS DIRECTORY)
#Using HMS defocused run 1267

#NOTE: WE will first use HMS defocused run 1267 to set up the correct time window/ref time cuts, and perform calibrations,
       since, it is on these runs where the focal plane gets illuminated uniformaly, so as to cover the majority of the
       each detector. 

1) Check reference time cuts are within established limits found in (/PARAM/HMS/GEN/h_reftime_cut.param) 
   Ensure that the reference time cuts made exclude un-wanted out of time reference times (look at it log-scale)
   --Replay the raw data and look at the leafs: 
     T.hms.hFADC_TREF_ROC1 (hhodo/hcer/hcal _adcrefcut)
     T.hms.hT1 (hhodo_tdcrefcut)
     T.hms.hDCREF1 (hdc_tdcrefcut)

2) Check AdcTdcTimeWindow Min/Max cuts found in /PARAM/HMS/{DETECOR}/h{detector}_cuts.param,  DETECTOR = HODO, DC, CER, CAL
   By setting limits on the ADC/TDC TimeDiff per PMT (requiring adc_multiplicity==1), we are excluding extraneous events which would have
   otherwise block events of interest in the main peak. These cuts increase the numbers of good triggers in the
   distribution (after we replay the data with the updated time window cuts). When determining the time window limits,
   a cut on the 'Good(Pos/Neg)AdcMult==1' was made to ensure we had only a single hit. When the data was replayed again, we ran set adc_mult >=1,
   to ensure we get good triggers that have multiplicity >1 

   Detectors---------Leafs of interest:			  
   
   HODO              H.hod.[plane_name].Good[side_name]AdcTdcDiffTime[ipmt], plane_name = 1x, 1y, 2x or 2y,  side_name = Pos, Neg
   		     H.hod.[plane_name].Good[side_name]AdcMult[ipmt]
 
   CAL               H.cal.[layer].good[side_name]]AdcTdcDiffTime[ipmt], layer = 1pr, 2ta, 3ta, 4ta, side_name = Pos, Neg
    		     H.cal.[layer].good[side_name]AdcMult[ipmt]
   
   CER               H.cer.goodAdcTdcDiffTime[ipmt], ipmt = 0 or 1
    		     H.cer.goodAdcMult[ipmt]

   DC                H.dc.[plane_name].rawtdc                    plane_name = 1u1, 1u2, . . . 2x2, 2v1, ...

INSTRUCTION TO RUN THE SCRIPT: setTimeWindows.C

>> root -l setTimeWindows.C

***What the script does:      
   This script takes as input a ROOT file (set manually inside the script), and loops over the leafs mentioned above and fills/plots the histograms with 
   vertical red lines indicating where the CUT region is set. The histograms are saved in the current directory in {.pdf} format.
   
   The reference time cuts values are hard-coded, and set at the beginning of the script. 
   These are the values found in the /PARAM/HMS/GEN/h_reftime_cut.param. The user may change them accordingly to their needs.

   The AdcTimeWindow Min/Max cut range are set at the beginning of the script, as multiples of sigma, called 'nSig'.
   Later in the script, the MEAN/SIGMA values for each ADC:TDC TimeDiff Histogram is determined, and the cut is set around  
   the MEAN +/- nSig*SIGMA.  The min./max. values are saved in a parameter file which is produced at /PARAM/HMS/{DETECOR}/h{detector}_tWin_runNUM.param
   These parameters must be copied manually to the /PARAM/HMS/{DETECOR}/h{detector}_cuts.param, so that they may be read by hcana during the replay.

DATE: JULY 5 2018

As of today, we are currently in the HMS detector calibration part of the analysis. 
The Hodoscopoes and Drift Chambers have been calibrated using the HMS defocused run 1267,
as the focal plane is ~ uniformly illuminated, which gives a wider calibration coverage than 
would otherwise give a normal run (with magnets properly tuned.) The Calorimeter, however, uses
track variables in its calibration procedure, therefore, a defocused run would NOT be appropiate.
From Vardan, the calorimeter calibration would only be valid for runs with the same kinematics (targt, angle, momentum, ...)
which may be combined to accumulate statistics. However, if the kinematics are different, they CANNOT be used,
as the results would NOT be good. For the calorimeter calibration, HMS run 1263 was used.

To check the calibration results of each detector for any run, execute the script  checkCalib.C

>> root -l
>> .L checkCalib.C
>> checkCalib(detector, runNUM)   //detector can be: "dc", "cal", "hod", "cer"    
                                     //The input root file has to be put in manually inside the code

This script will output a root file with the relevant histograms objects, as well as the .pdf files for quick view.
