During a coin. cosmic run, 4661, it was observed that the livetime measured
from HMS/SHMS singles was smaller than expected, as the rates were so low (2 Hz)
it was unlikely that more than a few events would be blocked by the BUSY.

It was found, by looking at the pTRIG1/pTRIG4 tdc Times (will all hits included),
that the there was more often than NOT, a second hit per event on the TDC Time window.

At these rates, every time a L1 Acc. comes, each TDC Channel looks back in time (~ 1 us) to look for any
signal that migh have arrived. If we look at pTRIG1 TDC Time itself, then ideally, we should find 1 hit per event.
This hit corresponding to the L1 Acc. However, over the course of many events, we find two distributions. One, corresponding
to the "good hits" (first hit in the lookback window), and the second peak corresponding to the second hit, which its
source is unknown at the moment. If it were to be background, it would have to be evenly distributed across the TDC window,
and the rates would have to be much higher.
