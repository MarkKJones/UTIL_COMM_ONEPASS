This directory contains information relevant to Hall C Beam/Spectrometer
offsets. These offsets have been determined from survey done on Summer 2017.

<HMS_mispointing>:
survey-summary   : document summarizing the HMS/SHMS Xtar/Ytar offsets in mm.
make_hist_bpm.C  : ROOT script to determine beam position offsets.

<fastRaster>:
Dir. containing plots of the fast Raster histograms in Raw ADC channels. The edge peaks of each of these
histograms is inputed in the gbeam.param file. Here is a list of the important parameters to check:
	   gfr_cal_mom  = 2.221  ; represents the beam energy 
	   gfr{xa,xb,ya,yb}_adcpercm = (maximum raw ADC channel - minimum raw ADC channel) / raster_size (cm)	 
           gfr{xa,xb,ya,yb}_adc_zero_offset = (maximum raw ADC channel + minimum raw ADC channel) / 2.

===================
The hallc_replay has these offsets in the (s)hmsflags.param as Horizontal/Verical spectrometer mispointings.
We still need to include the beam position offsets (obtained from EPICS) in gbeam.param, as gbeam_x and gbeam_y, using the make_hist_bpm.C script.
In the script, the gbeam_x and gbeam_y position offsets are in the hXtar and hYtar histograms (in mm).

In SIMC, both the spectrometer/beam position offsets must be included. Care must be taken when setting the signs of these offsets.
IMPORTANT** We are trying to make SIMC match the DATA, so in an Ideal System like SIMC, where there are NO offsets, we have to offset it
to make it look like  DATA. 
(The mispointing parameters in the spectrometer will cause a shift in xtar-xptar/ytar-yptar)

 AUGUST 07 2018:
=================
It was found that some parameters, like the raw ADC channel and beam energy in the gbeam.param needed to be updated.
This was found because the H.react.x had histogram (x-target position) had a natural offset, even when the param offsets
were set to zero. So an incorrect fast raster size would give an incorrect beam offset which in turn affects the
target variables like H.react.x  

The fast raster parameters were updated and now the react variables are centered at the origin. It was found however, that in the
SIMC currently being used (deut_simc), the coordinate system used throughout SIMC is the transport coordinate system. So a traslation
between the hallc_replay coordinate system and deut_simc is needed.

================
In the recent updates to the analyzer, the raw beam positions (gbeamx, gbeamy) in EPICS are directly read into hcana where they are converted to the Hall Coordinate 
system in H.react.x and H.react.y variables

The relevant leaf variables are:
