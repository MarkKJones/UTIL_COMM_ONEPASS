*Set Reference Time Cuts
*************************

The first step in Hall C Data Analysis, (once the data has been determined to
be OK) is to make sure the reference time cuts are set properly, as one needs
to make sure the correct reference times associated with the true physics events
are selected.

setTimeWindows:  Code to set reference time cuts (adc/tdc ref time)
		 based on the ref. time peak locations for various detectors,
		 such as hodoscopoes, drift chambers, cherenkovs, calorimeters.
		 Also set time window cuts on a PMT-basis.
