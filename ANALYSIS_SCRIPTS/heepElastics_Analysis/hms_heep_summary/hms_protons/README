 HMS Protons Studies
*********************

Brief: All coincidence elastics runs with HMS protons has been
gathered for HMS momentum studies. The study consists of
using a formula to calculate the proton momentum, which is
compared against the HMS measured momentum, H.gtr.p, on an event by
event basis. Ideally, the difference should give a delta peak at zero,
however, in reality, this peak might be offset if the momentum measured is
NOT what is supposed to be. 

1)The quantity of interest is:  dP / P = (P_calc - P_meas ) / P_meas
This calculation is done in SIMC and DATA, and them compared. It was found
that SIMC/DATA disagree, from which we can then measure this disagreement as
dP / P = (P_simc - P_data) / P_meas.  Where P_simc(or data) is the 
fitted peak  from (P_calc - P_meas) / P_meas.


2) It was found that dP_simc was an order of magnitude smaller than data, and with
   opposite sign.  We still need to compare SIMC to DATA no matter what. 
   dP = dP_data - dP_simc.   The correction is then: 
   ** P_corr = P + dP    --- Not using the information from W in the SHMS
